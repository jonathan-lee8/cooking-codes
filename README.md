# cooking-codes

Cooking codes was developed to have an application where users can share their best and/or favorite recipes with the rest of the world. Choosing what to make isn't always the easiest decision to make, but with this application, users can now browse through various courses, types of meals, photos, instructions, etc. Cooking codes will have user portals to login and logout to have their recipe information stored for later revisitation for updating and for viewing by others. 

## Installation

Please visit either links below to the Github repo or the deployed site. User can visit the Github link below and copy the SSH or HTTP key and clone the repo in their terminal portal. Once cloned, user can view the code implemented to see how code is functioning.
